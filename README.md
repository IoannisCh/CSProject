#Repository for the development of the Web Browser.

This repository was the work that I have submitted for my final project, for the degree of BSc Computer science.

If downloaded, as it is on a Linux machine (was developed in Ubuntu 22.04) and compiled should generate an executable file in the same folder.
(The repo was updated with my own executable, cannot know if it will run on every other machine). 

Feel free to contact me for comments.
