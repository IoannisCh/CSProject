#Repository for the development of the Web Browser.

This repository was the work that I have submitted for my final project, for the degree of BSc Computer science.

The web browser is in a very early stage, can load a static page for demostration purposes as it was completed 
in just under two months while I am working full time. 

The project was developed on an Ubuntu 22.04 machine with the usage of VS Code with Webkit Engine dependancies
and libraries.

If downloaded, as it is on a Linux machine  and compiled should generate an executable file in the same folder.
(The repo was updated with my own executable, cannot know if it will run on every other machine). 

Feel free to contact me for comments.
